        The Christian Action Resource Enterprise (CARE) is a non-profit organization that is devoted to empowering
        people and communities through the principles of Christianity. With the belief that every individual has value
        and potential, CARE provides a variety of resources and services to help people overcome challenges and live
        fulfilling lives. Some of the services they offer include counseling, educational resources, and outreach
        programs. By promoting social justice, human rights, and equality, CARE works to make a positive impact in the
        world. They strive to create a world where every person is treated with respect and dignity, and where everyone
        has the opportunity to achieve their goals. CARE is dedicated to spreading hope and healing to those who need it
